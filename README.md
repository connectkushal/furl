# What is this?

A library for building and running curl command fluently from php. Integration with laravel framework is out of the box. It is created as a basic wrapper for Curl and Process, a Symfony component for command line, based on what I needed in a few projects.

# Requirements
* PHP 7.1 or higher 
* curl

# Installation
Via composer
```bash
$ composer require connectkushal/furl
```

# Usage

# Feature Request and Support
If you need any other features of Curl or Process, you can add to [Wishlist.md](https://github.com/connectkushal/furl/Wishlist.md) by send a PR.
